# REAL ESTATE LANDING PAGE - TECHNICAL SHOWCASE

## OVERVIEW
A professional real estate landing page built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—demonstrating strong fundamentals in web development without relying on external frameworks or libraries. 
This project showcases the ability to create production-ready, fully responsive websites using only core web technologies.

## KEY TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
- **Pure CSS Layouts** - Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts, no framework dependencies
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - All interactive features built without jQuery or other libraries
- **Modular CSS Architecture** - Separated concerns with 8 distinct CSS modules for maintainability
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - Tested and working across all modern browsers
- **Performance Optimized** - WebP images, CSS animations, minimal HTTP requests

_⚠️ **Note**: This is a frontend-only project. The property search form is a static UI demonstration - it does not perform live filtering or connect to a database. Backend integration would be required for full functionality._
